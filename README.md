[Edit on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/origami101)

StackBlitz won't load image files correctly, so you'll probably need to host it on your own machine.

To run on your machine:
- pull the github code to a local repository
- navigate to the folder "origami-101" folder in your command line
- "npm run start"
*The first time you run it, you may need to do "npm i" first to download dependencies


MongoDB:

After install, to run:
- C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.4\bin>"mongod.exe --dbpath "C:\data"
- C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.4\bin>mongo.exe
